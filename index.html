                    <p>My name is Alex Obaseki, currently a student at the University of Minnesota coding boot camp. I have
                        been facsinated by technology since I was a kid, no, since I was a baby. I remember wondering how
                        cars moved around without visible electrical wires hanging out from their rear, then I also thought
                        that will be a difficult and convuluted arrangement to manage due to the fact that a handful of
                        people own cars in my neighborhood at the time. Children's thought right, I know.</p>
                    <br>

                    <p> I initially was interested in Petroleum Engineering(the biggest industry in my native Nigeria) and then
                        Mechanical Engineering, however somehow I found myself enrolled for a Computer Engineering program(the
                        only available associate degree at the time at college closest to me). Then I fell in love with computers
                        after taking courses in Microprocessors and Microcomputers. Even without computers to play around
                        with my interest in Information and Communication Technology remained as witted as when I first took
                        those classes as teenager. I have an associate in Computer Engineering, Bachelors in Computer Science,
                        and a Master of Engineering in Computer Software and Theory. I also studied some Chinese along the
                        way from my time in China and I am happy and looking forward to adding this coding boot camp certification
                        to my list of achievements.</p>
                    <br>

                    <p>I love traveling, though I haven't done much in that area, I would love to travel the world some day.
                        I love learning, all sort of things, from Medicine, to Geography, to History (kind of jack of all
                        trade and master of none).</p>
